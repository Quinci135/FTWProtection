Replaces for the worthy bombs with other projectiles  
On for the worthy, skeletron prime bombs will destroy tiles when they explode and bombs can fall out of trees when shaken or when pots are broken.  
These are replaced with non-destructive projectiles. In this case, both are hard-coded to use beehives, matching the current dg survival world (drunk + expert + not the bees + ftw flag).  
Could use cannonballs for prime bombs with how similar they are. Bombs from the environment could be replaced with an item drop or any other projectile.
